When I first received my Amazon gift card, I was a little unsure about it.  I mean, I'd heard of amazon before, but I wasn't sure about ordering from some small website out there in the far reaches of the Internets.  It's not Wal-Mart, you know.  When I went to the site (www.amazon.com), I was shocked and amazed at the tantalizing variety of goods that they carry.  Where else can I find Maine lobster tails and an ear and nose hair trimmer?<br /><br />And get this, they ship it to you, anywhere.  Pretty cool.<br /><br />On to the gift card...  The one I got was the $200 variety.  I felt like it didn't have enough buying power.  Sure, it's much better than the $25 one, but I really had my eye on the $500.  I got one of those from work one time and it was great.  It too didn't last as long as I had hoped though.  Anyway, $200 was a pretty good gift card if you are looking for a bunch of small to mid-size things (except jewelry, stay out of jewelry if you get the $200 one).  I ordered some lobster tails, a nose hair trimmer, some headphones, sunglasses and 4 music books.  All in all, I'd say I got a pretty good stretch out of my $200 gift card.  About $200 worth, so I can't complain.",2012,2012-06-04,Gift Card

A lot of stuff doesn't work the way the in game descriptions say it will work.  Expect it to crash more and more frequently as you get farther along in the game.  I am on turn 200 in a multiplayer game with my brother and it crashes every other turn at least.<br /><br />Since there isn't much out there in the way of 4x space empire games with multi-player capability, buy this game if you want. Just be ready to spend alot of time figuring things out.  Documentation is poor.  Community support is scarce.  And its a fairly slow paced game so figuring out things yourself will take a while. Steam said I had played the game for 200 hours before I had figured out enough work around tricks to bump my review up from a one star to a three.  Once that is done however, if you like this type of game you will be having fun.<br /><br />The most recent work around I figured out was that the host of a game can use a battle manager button that is normally blocked for payers during multi-player games.  If they do this, then it bugs the battle out and causes the other players in the battle to be unable to see the hosts ships resulting in a easy win for the host.  For the first several battles my friends and I didn't know what was causing the invisible ships bug and we were loading the game any time this happened.  It was horrible.  Once we learned to avoid the bug, the game was much more fun.hese gates regularly in order to maintain any kind of speed.  As a result, a certain amount of pathing is required in order to travel long distances as several gates must be tagged along the way in order to maintain speed.  This pathing makes less sense than commercial budget flights that have you flying from LA to New York and then back to Seattle in order to finally end up in Dallas.  The result is that players have to manually plan shorter jumps that further slow the fleet movements of this race because every turn the ships come to a stop even if they could have continued on for several light years had pathing worked.  This is frustrating because the Loa are already the slowest of all the races at interstellar travel.<br /><br />Oh and then there is the horrible mission system that often can't tell what fleets can do what missions resulting in the player, who is determined to get this colony mission started, to find a long list of work around moves in order to get the game moving like it was intended.<br /><br />In short, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.  Reports that the bugs have been fixed and it is now playable have been greatly exaggerated.",2013,2013-10-31,Digital_Video_Games

US,33848786,RSAS70IKLNIPQ,B00BXONG7G,240448759,Battlefield 4,4,2,9,N,Y,I am very pleased!!!,"I was kind of shocked to hear that EA was coming out with BF4 so fast, in my opinion they could have kept BF3 going for quite some time will upgrades and expansions.  Now lets get to the game!!!<br /><br />SINGLE PLAYER<br />I am unlike the majority of gamers because I always like to play through the single player first then Multiplayer.  I do this becasue I enjoy playing the single player as well as seeing most of the weapons before hand.  I really enjoyed single player, and I also enjoyed BF3 single player along with all the COD's that I have played but BF single player is the only ones that I actually payed attention to the story lines. It is short but if you didn't expect that I don't know what to tell you.  Should they make it longer...of course but I don't think that will happen.  They did make little changes that I really enjoyed, and they are below:<br /><br />PROS:<br />- They made it wear you get to pick your weapons from your weapons cache for each level and you can pick up enemy weapons or change your load out at any ammo cache or weapons cache throughout the level.  I really enjoyed this aspect for the fact that I like to have a long range and medium range weapon.<br />- It kind of reminded me of playing multipler a little bit.  You get points for killing enemies and more for headshots or alternate kills and your points go up against medals for each level, Bronze, Silver, Gold.  Each medal you get, you unlock weapons for your weapons cache's that you can use in Singleplayer.<br />- It seemed a little more open, at times you would come across a random tank and you could either get in it or go on foot.  You can blow up a tank with a tank or get out and C4 it, or take it down with a rocket launcher of Sorts<br /><br />CONS<br />- Obviously short but I expected it<br />- The ending was ok but I expected a lot more.  It just seemed that it just kind of ended, like there is going to be more but then nothing happened.<br />- The singleplayer crashed twice on me while I was playing it.  Didn't loose too much progress but had to restart the entire game.<br /><br />MULTIPLAYER<br />I have logged about 10 hours on multiplayer and I must say I am overall, pleased.  Here are the pros and cons<br /><br />PROS:<br />- Huge maps (Ofcourse) and all of them that I have played have some sort of interaction that happens in the map.  Such as one map floods, huge destruction in others, and an island map that in the middle a storm rolls in and creates big waves and low visability.  Makes the gameplay amazing.<br />- Lots of weapons with lots of attachments.  Multiple rocket launchers that do all kinds of stuff<br />- One of the main changes I have seen is they took the C4 away from Support and gave it to Recon.  So now your not completely worthless as a sniper when it comes to tanks.<br />- They also added little Ammo and Health pacs as well as keeping the big ones from BF3 and you can equipt which ever one to use as Medic or Support.  I did notice that the small ammo pack only gives you ammo for your pistol and sidearm, it does not fill your grenades and rockets.<br />- You can zoom in and out with one of the scopes and you can set your range on some of them.  Which is a nice feature.<br />- They have weapon drops throughout the game now with random weapons that you can go and get.  They are marked on the map with a pistol.<br />- Ocean Warefare.  The vehicles for the water are awesome, especially the but war boat(Can't remember the name)They also have dingys, sea-doos.  This plus the waves in the storm are pretty epic.<br />- Another bit thing that I really like is the fact that you can dive and swim UNDERWATER as well as pull your pistol and shoot while treading water.  So now your not completely worthless while swimming anymore.<br />CONS<br />- CRASHES, I played for 2-3 hours last and it crashed 4 times.  Twice while switching levels which didnt upset me to bad but then the other 2 times were during the game after I had unlocked multiple things and made quite a few points.  That upsets me.  It has crashed quite a few times since I have had the game so I hope they work out the bugs<br />- SOUND I will be playing a round and the surrounding sound will go away except my gunfire.  Then it will come back and go away again.  I see there are multiple people having this problem so I Hope they fix that soon.  It doesn't happen every round but most of them.<br /><br />I will think of more things as I play and I will update as needed.  Thank you for reading and have fun gaming.<br /><br />-Nick<br /><br />UPDATE November 14 2013<br /><br />So these things have been going on since the beginning and I knocked off a star because of it.  I waited for a big update and that came today but it still has some ridiculous issues.<br /><br />LOOSING XP<br />- So in the beginning a server would crash and you would loose your points in that round....that does not happen as often now but it still happens.<br />- The one thing that really pisses me off is when I finish a round and I quit before it loads the next map and it says BF4 has stopped working and I loose about a 1/3 of my XP from that round.  THAT NEEDS to be FIXED.  I am tired of getting the same rank 3-4 times before it finally takes.  Just to name a couple I ranked up to level 11 4 times and level 29 3 times because it does not keep my xp.  At one point I played 3 rounds, got my longest headshot and gained around 30k points and unlocked 6 things and I quit after the third round and it didnt keep any of my stats from those 3 games.....wow really?  I dont mind if it happened every now and then but this is ridiculous.<br /><br />I waited for the update and when I joined my first map every 15 seconds or so my screen would go a little fuzzy for a split second and come back.  Updated drivers and it worked for about a round and it still does it every now and then. Also my first 2 rounds after the update my teamates were killing me (I only play HC servers) saying Ididnt have a friendly symbol above my head and I was also killed by multiple people that had a friendly symbol and it said they were the enemy.<br /><br />All and all I don't see much of an improvement...yet...please make another update!!!<br /><br />UPDATE 27 November 2013<br /><br />CRASHES:<br /><br />- I hardly come by a crash anymore.  The game has crashed once in the last 15hrs of gameplay and that was about 10 seconds after joining a server.<br /><br />HIT COLLISION<br /><br />- There seems to be something off with the hit collision in the game and it seems to be getting worse, at least in my opinion.  I play only HC servers and in multiple maps with multiple enemy's I would hit them with no less than 20-30 rounds and I could see the bullets hitting them and this is at close range without them moving, but they never go down and they still read 100 on health.  Using the same pistol in everymap usually you can kill enemies with 2-4 bullets and less if it was in the head.  But them some enemies take and entire clip and still read full health.  This is the main thing upsetting me in this game now.<br /><br />COVER<br /><br />- Enemies can shoot me from behind cover just with the tips of their heads sticking out, and I mean the tip...barely visable.  My friend and I tested this out and when we got behind cover and had the same amount showing and fired a round it just hit the cover in front of us.  Not a huge deal but it gets frustrating.<br /><br />All and all I am really enjoying the game.  I just wanted to update you on some things that caught my eye.  Thanks for reading and I hope to see you in there.",2013,2013-10-31,Digital_Video_Games

After years of waiting for BF4 you disappoint.,"Ive been a fan of the series since BF 1942 and was excited about what was going to be brought to the table for BF4 as it had been talked about for some time. Many had even told me to hold off on BF3 as BF4 would be that much better. It's pretty disappointing to finally get my hands on it and feel let down in many ways. It's a retread... I honestly don't see much need for this game, there is no big step up. It feels like it could have been an expansion or new story line for BF3. As many mentioned not being able to group with friends going into multiplayer is a HUGE let down. I largely only game with friends when I play and to jump through hoops to finally get on the same server in the same squad is ridiculous. And don't get me started on the Battlepacks as you may need to purchase these for some of the ideal attachments that you would want for multiplayer. Does that not scream money grab? The single player is a bit disappointing as well, though some of the missions are engaging it's overall very short and just sort of ends... It's very apparent this is so they can sell you each of the next 5 preplanned expansion packs. Or you can pre-purchase them now with a \\""Premium Membership\\"" for $50. I know BF3 had this but after playing the abbreviated campaign in BF4 it starts to get to you. I had not intended to spend $110 on the complete game. I've loved the BF franchise, but this release has been a pretty big turn off. When it comes time to buy the next gen BF I will definitely wait until the verdict is in from the fans/gamers.<br /><br />***I had to edit my review. I felt bad giving it two stars but after two days of trying to play with friends I felt I needed to revisit it.<br /><br />The current condition of the game is unacceptable. I understand EA/Dice wanted to beat COD to the punch on release but they are alienating what once was a solid fan base. Over the two days of multiplayer play with friends we have spend 40% of the time recovering from game and server crashes.As a result any progress we were working towards with item unlocks went to waste. One of my friends is trying to return the game at this point. If you haven't purchased it yet, I would highly recommend waiting for another game... It's really not worth the frustration. The game is pretty broken in it's current state.",2013,2013-10-31,Digital_Video_Games

The computer is NOT effected by the FOW, (fog of war). It seems like it plays at trying to make you believe it can't see you, but it can. (i.e. hide something out in a corner of the map, away from everything. Without a scout or any hint of something  \\""finding\\"" you. The computer will head right to you.<br /> 2. This game should have been called Exploit Rampage, or Super Bum Rush.... There was obviously hundreds of hours put into thinking up all the different vehicles and characters...Buuuuut the only way  to win many of the battles is to use exploits. Forget studying all the details about what shoots how far, and balancing your air and cav to achieve the right force balance. Screw it, just hover cheap ERS air units over your targets and let them shoot them down and they will become the most powerful bombs in the game. Or just bum rush you opponent with a Dojo and flood the computers base with tank busters. Nice to know all the work on those beautiful stats and details went to waste.<br /> 3. BUGS...enormous numbers of console locking bugs. On multiple occasions I have been ready to deal the killing blow, but guess what. I can't... why?... don't know. push the button and NOTHING....<br /> 4. the computers AI is smart... your troops are not. 9 times out of 10 you send a troop to do something and it will take the longest route or the route that will get it killed. I've seen engineers circle an oil well TWICE before it finally tried to capture it. Your troops will always, ALWAYS shoot at the least important target. They with ALWAYS shoot at the thing not shooting at them (unless that thing is the only thing in the area). They will NEVER shoot at the thing shooting them. (unless again there is only one thing in the area)<br /> 5.  The computer can execute millions of commands before you can even think about what you want to do. AND it does.  Most of the time its like playing against 50 other players.<br />6. You cant take any of the new units back to the old game...FAIL...",2013,2013-10-31,Digital_Video_Games

Then, about a year later, they gave it the &#34;all clear&#34; patch, saying they finally considered it ready for release...but imho, it is still far from playable.  The game is plagued with frequent crashes.  In multiplayer, it seems some players, for no apparent reason, are restricted from using the Battle Manager, a very important combat tool.  Several techs in the tech tree seem to have no apparent effect, and obviously do not function as they are worded.  Many techs that do work, require actions be taken that are very unclear and not included in any documentation, requiring extensive searching through forums and wikis for answers.  Most recently, when playing multiplayer with my brother, we've encountered a bug where after he kills one of my NPG gates in combat, he bugs out so that he can't see my fleet, allowing my ships to kill his nearly defenseless and uncontrollable fleet (no stealth techs involved..) The Mission system for tasking fleets is VERY broken, especially if you play the Loa, as it creates hidden 'paths' as you deploy NPG gates, and it uses these 'paths' to calculate supply limits for fleet destinations, and recommends these as the 'fastest route' compared to the 'direct route' even when the direct route takes half the time to get there.  This also leads to some stars being far more difficult to reach, and many other bugs.<br /><br />If you really want this game, buy Sword of the Stars instead, not this so-called flop of a sequel.<br />Furthermore, in single player, the AI, even on hard (which gives it a 25% bonus to population growth, 25% bonus to economy (which is based primarily on population) and a 25% bonus to research (paid for by your economy), it fails to put up a decent fight.<br /><br />If they continue to patch this game, it might be playable, in, say, a year or so...but I doubt it, as even the mechanics that are &#34;working as intended&#34; such as the mission system, only make the game more cumbersome than it should be.",2013,2013-10-31,Digital_Video_Games

When I first bought the game I was impressed with the battle system not being as stodgy as the first one. It really makes the first Guild Wars look like trash. The graphics, obviously, are improved and work out even at max settings for an MMORPGs. The game definitely has a variety of items, NPCs, events (daily, area and story), and abilities to keep you occupied for a good amount of time. There's the living story idea of updating the game world every two weeks, which is ambitious in my opinion.<br /><br />When I first started playing I loved the game because of the fact I could beat higher leveled NPCs myself with a variety of strategies including running away! I like the fact you could get defeated by an NPC, call for help in the area chat then have a random player come right over to either revive you and help you defeat or defeat the NPC and then revive you. I focused on completing story quests and the exploration tasks.<br /><br />It has a really enjoyable experience as there is so much to do, but I think I burned out playing the game like I did and haven't gotten back into playing it.

Check vs Mate does in fact remind me a little of Battle Chess in that the pieces animate and physically do battle when one piece takes another.  Check vs Mate is eye candy, through and through, when compared to the later releases of the Chessmaster series.  As an owner of Chessmaster 9000, I can create tournaments, adjust AI personalities, be given a Chess rating, the works.  Check vs Mate doesn't do these things, but it does what it sets out to do well...create a cinematic, realistic game where the pieces and landscapes come to life.<br /><br />For those of you Chess veterans who want much more depth in a Chess program, I'd advise staying with Chessmaster 9000 or its equivalent.  If you're looking for a pretty Chess game that adds an Archon-like twist to combat along with an array of special features and modes, then it couldn't hurt to give this a shot.  Personally, I switch off between both programs, depending on my mood.  Check vs Mate has some good qualities about it, but lack of some of the options that my copy of Chessmaster has keeps me from fully recommending it.

Everything we've come to love about this game is present and improved.

It took me about four to five hours to complete, though your experience may vary depending on how often you seek assistance from the in-game help system.  The narrative and voice acting were excellent, the art was fantastic, and the mystery element kept me engaged through and through.  I don’t want to ruin the story, but suffice it to say that it didn’t resolve as much about the main plot as I thought it would.  Will McAdams and Erica ever see eye to eye?  Is there something more to Cordelia, like I think there is?  Will Erica ever recover from Melissa’s banshee-esque singing voice?  Who are the oracle and “The Wise Monkey” killer?

Leave it to EA to continually put visual masks over terrible game mechanics.  I expected something new and what I feel like I got was a bad BF3.<br /><br />Game play balancing between infantry and vehicles is terrible, if you are not in a group of engineers or a tank good luck trying to go anywhere in the majority of the maps.  It takes 5 rockets to destroy a single tank.  I also managed to rpg a helicopter in the tail and it hit for 7 vehicle damage.... 7....<br /><br />Aerial vehicles lack sensitivity adjustments.  Why would the developers of the game assume I want the same sensitivity for my gun as flying a jet?<br /><br />The client side registration is delayed still so it appears to take 8+ bullets to kill someone when in fact they are already dead it just hasn't updated.  Also when people go to kill you it sounds like 2-3 bullets because of the delay.<br /><br />There is a win7 FPS/CPU usage glitch that they have known about since beta but still haven't fixed.  No I don't want to buy windows 8.<br /><br />I haven't looked into solutions for this issue but my main sound (footsteps, gunfire, vehicle) will turn off randomly and all I will hear is faint radio sounds and aerial vehicles far away  (again I didn't bother looking into this so it may be different for you).<br /><br />There is no grace period when spawning so prepare to be instakilled if you spawn near battle.<br /><br />You start with one weapon option for each kit, one.  Good idea, I don't like variety.<br /><br />When enemies are getting shot they can still run at full pace, your bullets mean nothing to them.<br /><br />The movement is rough and you can get caught on the terrain a lot.

This sums up the entire game (this sums up most modern games in fact).  No, you can't turn it off, and as a player, I utilize everything that the designers allow me to utilize, that's my job.  You design the game, I play it.

And according to 2k themselves, this years version also improves on the game play, animation and overall balance of the game versus its predecessors.<br /><br />Like many sports games, you're given the choice of playing a quick game or diving head first into the fray of a exhausting 82 game season. Other options include Black Top, Practice and of course, you can step into the size 16 shoes of King James himself and take a magical mystery ride towards his Path to Greatness. This mode, reminiscent of last years Jordan Challenge allows you to play 'what if' scenarios based on a intriguing series of events in which it takes the coveted cover athlete into different teams or has you trying to manage him appropriately to keep him in Miami. It's an interesting concept, especially if you are a Heat fan, as it tends to keep you motivated to see what he does next. Keep in mind that this feature is consequence based, meaning you'll need to keep winning games to keep the plot line going.<br /><br />The other interesting change is the new Pro-Stick feature. This allows you to dribble, pass and shoot using the right stick modifier. Personally, I like the option of having it there if I need it, but it often lends itself to causing more frustration than anything else. Too many times have I passed when I wanted to shoot or I shot when I wanted to dribble. I know I need to make adjustments to my game, but placing this feature in 'right away' is sort of debilitating. After years of getting used to the controls of previous 2K games, throwing this new control scheme at me is like switching the steering wheel to the right side of the car .. at least implement it slowly and let me get use to it.<br /><br/>On the gameplay side is where 2K really shines. The graphics are sharper although not significantly improved over last years version. I've played both the PS3 and PC version and while the console boast more working features (MP, Team Mode), the PC actually has the better graphics and sharper images. Zoom in and you can see the facial stubles on Tim Duncan and laugh lines around the geeky face of Kobe. Add the capabilities of user created mods and the PC rises head and shoulders above the rest. In fact, many mods available now make the PC version look just as good as early preview shots of the game from the PS4.<br /><br />2K also boast over 'thousands of new animations' but I honestly haven't really noticed that many; maybe I just wasn't looking or have become oblivious to that fact. But I have seen better boxing out, better movement during pick n rolls, players reacting better when they get called for a foul and players getting knocked down when a defender jumps into them after taking a shot etc.. But I have yet to see the 'thousands of animations' as of yet. But believe me, I'll be looking.<br /><br />One of the better feature in this this years version is the enhance blocking system - and I do mean enhanced. Players will not just raise their arms up like generic robots trying to block a shot, but they will now rear back and swat it away like it was a beach ball filled with dynamite. I've seen players flick their wrist to swat a shot as it was at the height of its trajectory and I've seen shots get blocked and pinned against the back board. When 2k said they made blocking better .. they weren't messing around. And even though I thoroughly enjoy the blocking system, it can also get comical as well; I've witnessed a blocked shot bounce of another players head, then bounce off and get blocked again towards the back board into the waiting arms of the point guard. I know these are dynamic random events, but they happen pretty consistently in every other game I play.Sometimes, you just want to turn off the 2K soundtrack and add in your own version of the Benny Hill theme......<br /><br />Read the rest of the review here: [...]",2013,2013-10-30,Digital_Video_Games

I guess just to see what all the fuss was about.  People rant and rave about how great this game is, and I think sometimes people just enjoy the ride quality of the bandwagon.  The game was a horribly ugly port to PC, the devs couldn't even be bothered to make the game look good by PC standards, so some modder quickly put together a hack to bump up the visuals in the game.  That at least made the visuals go from being too ugly to bring out in front of company, to just regular ugly.  A couple hours into the game and I don't get much of a storyline, there's not much in the way of dialogue, and all I've done is go from one area to the next, killing annoyingly cheap monsters.  Yeah yeah, there's the huge dragon near the beginning of the game that kills you in maybe two, three hits tops.  Once you figure out the right way to attack him, it's no biggie, but aside from that, the controls are dreadful.  When you are attacking a foe, you have to make sure the analog stick is aimed just so, and if the foe moves the slightest bit, you have to readjust--your character does not lock onto the character you're attacking so it feels a bit clumsy. Also, the skeletons can take one last cheap shot at you as they're falling to the ground, &#34;dying&#34;.  That is annoying as well, since you can't afford to lose energy b/c if you die and get resurrected, all the enemies you've killed are resurrected as well.  The game is very grainy and abysmal looking, with very uninspired visuals, and with not much of a story (so far) I just can't force myself to be tortured any further. I doubt I will bother with this game anymore.  It barely feels like an RPG and more like a 3-D version of Final Fight, except way more difficult, uglier, and even less rewarding.

They've patched and fixed many of the glaring issues that made the game so frustrating at times (the utilities and traffic patterns in particular).  The game is also infinitely more playable than it used to be, and the single player mode caters to those who were clamoring for it for so long.<br /><br />That having been said, the game still feels remarkably shallow for a game that claims to be so deep in it's simulation.  My personal opinion is that the game still lacks a lot of what made the franchise what it is.  The city size still feels incredibly small, even with additional regions for building.  There's just a certain level of frustration that comes with not being able to build where you want to.<br /><br />Overall, I'd recommend passing on the game.  It's fun for a little while, you'll get a few days entertainment out of it, but then you'll put it down and forget about it.  It just doesn't have the same replay value as those that came before it.  In addition, EA really dropped the ball on listening to fans about what features were broken and needed fixing.  Some simply can't be fixed.  It took an expansion to get the game to what I would call \\""release-ready\\"" and that says a lot about what you're buying.<br /><br />*Edit 3/30/14: After putting in a lot more playtime, I've decided to lower my review to one star.  I've found this expansion to be just as frustrating as the original game.  The \\""MegaTowers\\"" which are the real focus of the expansion are extremely buggy, with residents complaining about not having things that DO exist inside of the tower.  This leads to unhappy residents and completely wasted space.  In addition, it completely tanks your city because you'll start bleeding money from the MegaTower.  These issues didn't always happen, but they happened frequently enough to kill any desire I had to keep playing.  Until those issues are patched, this is yet another unplayable gamereleased by EA before it was thoroughly play-tested.  I guess I don't know why I expected any different with the expansion.",2014,2014-03-24,Digital_Video_Games

US,30853647,R1IH7741O1B0OH,B007VFHGZ4,675980058,Tomb Raider,5,1,1,N,Y,"Scintillating, exhilarating and Intense!!","Three words that can't do justice enough to describe this game. This is really more than a game, its about discovery of an island and Lara's self belief, the secrets that hide in the world and what good game development can really produce.<br /><br />1. Story  - 3.5/5 - An important part of any game for me is story and this game has a pretty decent one. A shipwrecked crew on an island searching for a mysterious past, filled with modern day beliefs and ancient cults. One discovery after another makes this game a really fast paced adventure. As crew member relations develop and yet feel shallow at moments, it is a mix of emotions. At times, I felt sorry for the people trapped on the island (The Solarii and other factions), they had no other resort but to follow a cultist leader. They did not choose that fate, nobody did. All this and much more can be found in side conversations.<br /><br />2. GamePlay  - 4.5/5 - Gameplay is as solid as you will find in any Action/Adventure games and probably that is the strongest point of this title. Handling and shooting guns feels natural, killing foes with bow is just amazing. As Lara becomes more and more adept at firing arrows, (with upgrades) the game feels great. The AI is superb and enemies attack, flank, throw grenades and rush Lara (all this adds to the intense fights). There is a perfect balance of tools that Lara has to counter the foes she faces. The puzzles do feel too easy at times and they do not seem to make an impact on the game as was prominent in older Tomb raider games. This is definitely more action-oriented.<br /><br />3. Graphics  - 4.5/5 - The graphics are top-notch. I played the games in 1600*900 and it looked amazing with Post pocessing affects. Lighting is superb and the textures are very well done. As you would expect from an adventure game, each detail pops out, be it from a simple vase on a shelf or the staues of the Queen. The art is very vivid. Most praise should be given to the surroundings and the varied areas to explore.<br /><br />4. Immersive Soundtrack - 4.0/5 - The soundtrack in this game is good. It ups the tempo in tense firefights and tones down while navigating areas. Exploring tombs is more fun with the sweet sound of achievement. The voice- acting could have been done better but atleast the main characters (Lara, Roth, Mathias)  have given a solid performance.<br /><br />All in all, I enjoyed playing this game. Even though the Boss fight in the end was easier than I anticipated (Hard Mode), it was fun.<br /><br />Hope you will enjoy playing this game, just as much as I did. And oh, pick up this game on sale, its usually $7.00 on steam and amazon.",2014,2014-03-24,Digital_Video_Games

It does not directly give you any in-game currency, although being under subscription status will make you eligible for the  500 cartel coins grant each month.  You'll also get to use more characters, go into flash points without having to pay for the privilege with cartel coins, sometimes even allow early access to new game features.<br /><br />The major benefits for choosing the online game code over other versions, in my humble opinion, are as follows:  1) Instant download--within seconds you have your game code, can redeem it using your account, and get to playing your game.  No need for driving, waiting at the checkout, opening a nice shinny package only to dump it in the trash a few minutes later (although the physical cards are kinda cool for a moment...but still go into the trash can).  2) Not having to use your credit card with yet another vendor that might lose your data or have it stolen.  3) Low price (second lowest price I've seen, ever, for this item.  Other time was on clearance, they didn't know what they were selling, I got lucky).

There are myriad glitches throughout the game some of which can be a pretty big headache if you're shooting for 100% completion. I don't think that it being a digital version of the game matters much as a little research around the web seems to suggest it's game in general and not digital vs. disc and I believe it may be an issue across platforms as well.<br /><br />All of that being said I give the game a 2-star rating mainly because of the annoying programming issues, long load times and inability to skip some interludes, and a slight repetitiveness in some of the gameplay.

And the game won't run without being logged on to the account, nor will it run standalone without the middleware running on your PC.

US,39006763,RDTOW5P1W68ZM,B004LLIKVU,473048287,Amazon.com eGift Cards,2,2,3,N,Y,I had a problem,"I bought this gift card for myself to use because Amazon doesn't allow you to use multiple credit cards to make a purchase. I had a visa gift card with 100 bucks on it and I wanted to buy some stuff so the way I've done it before is to buy and Amazon gift card because then you CAN use it and another credit card. So I placed my order and entered the code number on the Amazon gift card. Something didn't seem right, maybe I made a mistake somewhere, but the Amazon gift card didn't take and the full purchase price of the items went on my check card instantly making me over-drawn at the bank.<br /><br />This is where I have nothing but positive things to say about Amazon. Even though I was initially irate about this situation, I called Amazon customer service and the man on the phone was as helpful as he could be. I'd give Amazon customer service 5 stars even though I'm ticked off about the gift card. Anyways, I just moved some money around between accounts and resolved it for myself. I really think the Amazon check out process could be more transparent. Your items should be visible on the right hand side of the web page at all times with the price and any applicable shipping charges. There should also be a way to use multiple visa cards and set an amount for one card while the second card would pay the balance. There should also be a line to show you any gift card adjustments or coupon codes or whatever. A customer should always know exactly what he/she is paying and have ways of using discounts, coupons or gift cards. I have another money making idea for Amazon, but I'm not going to blab about it here. Call Amazon, it's a big time money maker.",2014,2014-06-28,Gift Card

They can be used for storage of buttons, screws, tacks, coins, etc. But this one is not just a top and bottom with a removable gift card holder. The bottom has a rectangular slot cut out with a plastic window sloppily glued in so the barcode on the gift card can be scanned. This, in my opinion, ruins the uniqueness of the tin and once the plastic (easily) breaks out, it's not an effective storage tin.<br /><br />Thus it becomes trash and adds - at least a little - to some landfill. If you're going to give a gift card, of course do it. But perhaps think about the residue that will be left behind once the gift card is used. Is it any less thoughtful to send an e-gift-card code?

It was so easy to have gift cards from Amazon delivered electronically. The process was immediate, and I got notice both that the orders were completed and when they were received by each recipient. I also appreciate that Amazon offers a religiously themed card directly related to the meaning of Christmas rather than just something bland, like &#34;Happy Holidays.&#34; The recipients were glad to get Amazon gift cards because they realize they can buy a number of things at Amazon beyond just books.

The amounts are in rigid increments, not variable.  I must have missed reading something because, I didn't read anything about a receipt verification,  the fact that there was a receipt made the 2nd star.<br /><br />My sister had her 70th birthday near to Christmas and we wanted to get her a card with $70 (a dollar for each year), but had to settle for the $75 increment.  I'm not winging over the increment of $75, just the lack of one for $70.  The amount on a gift card should be totally flexible.  It's not like anyone has to do any math in accounting.  What about the specific 'Dream Gift'?  What if it's total was (in example), $13.42?  Wouldn't it be special to have the card with that amount and a thumbnail image of the present it was intended for, yet giving the receiver the option to use the card towards something else?<br /><br />It was the rigid increments and lack of information on delivery and non-delivery status.  A customer shouldn't have to go looking for such information, or refer to an FAQ.  It should be posted at point of sale that the giver will receive a note of receipt and that if the card isn't retrieved within 90 days of being sent, a notice of non-receipt will be sent to both partied.  Also ... The giver of a gift card should not be charged until receipt has been verified.

It doesn't wrap well, it looks like it would have a flimsy, insubstantial feel, and it looks like the best it could be used for is cleaning under your nails, scraping THIN ice off your windshield (agian, looked flimsy), or partitioning fine-grained solids into nice orderly piles and/or lines.<br /><br />But then I got the card in hand and could tell that this was a much more substantial material.  I was about to make a new friend because this thing can obviously scrape some pretty moderately thick ice off your windshield.<br /><br />My friend called me up, raving about the series of books that I bought him for his birthday.  I was confused at first.  I just got him this card.  How can you possibly read a book, let alone a series, with this thin piece of plastic?  Did they section it so thin that it actually IS a book?  I never tested the edges for pages.  Unable to come up with a reasonable answer, I finally asked my friend what he was talking about.  I told him that he must be confused, because I only got him a rectangle of plastic.<br /><br />Wouldn't you know it, but instead of putting a BOOK within the card, they put MONEY in the card.  Had I known this, I would have definitely investigated the edges a lot closer for the hidden latch, taken the money for myself, and then handed my friend his ice scraper.  But I will remember for next time.<br /><br />This is an incredible product and you should buy lots of it!!!  Just be sure you find that hidden latch and take out the money first!  Oh Amazon... what will they think of next?",2013,2013-01-20,Gift Card
